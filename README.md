# Stock Price Prediction Prototype

This project implements a neural network-based stock price prediction model using PyTorch. The model takes historical stock data as input and predicts future stock prices.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Neural network model with multiple fully connected layers
- Training and testing functionality
- Support for time series data with sliding windows

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pransil/prototype1.git
cd prototype1
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your data in the required format
2. Run the model:
```bash
python model.py
```

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the neural network model and training logic
- `prepare_data.py`: Data preprocessing utilities
